# Presentation Materials Walkthrough

## Overview

I've created complete materials for your 20-minute IPD video presentation, consisting of two main artifacts:

1. **Presentation Slides** (16 slides)
2. **Speech Script** (20 minutes, precisely timed)

### Speech Features

✅ **Precise Timestamps:** Every section has exact start/end times  
✅ **Word Count Calibrated:** ~140 words/minute for natural delivery  
✅ **Transition Cues:** Smooth bridges between topics  
✅ **Emphasis Markers:** Notes on which technical terms to stress  
✅ **Pacing Guidance:** Where to slow down for statistics, speed up for transitions

## Key Content Highlights

### Problem Statistics (Compelling)
- 1.5 million people affected by 2016-2017 floods
- LKR 100+ billion economic losses annually
- 25% increase in flood risk by 2050 (World Bank projection)

### Technical Achievements (Impressive)
- 800ms average risk calculation (60% faster than 2s target)
- 99%+ API uptime (exceeds 95% requirement)
- Point-in-Polygon algorithm with O(n×m) complexity
- 100% dependency injection architecture

### Research Gap (Well-Justified)
- Compared 4 existing system limitations
- Matched each with your solution
- Cited 3+ peer-reviewed papers (Zhang, Silva, IPCC)

### Progress Evidence (PPRS Comparison)
- Before PPRS: Requirements document only
- After PPRS: Fully functional prototype with all 6 FRs implemented

## Recording Recommendations

### Preparation
1. **Practice 3 times minimum** with timer
2. **Export slides to PDF** to avoid software crashes
3. **Test screen recording** before final take
4. **Have water nearby** (you'll be talking for 20 minutes straight)

### Technical Setup
- **Resolution:** 1080p minimum
- **Software:** OBS Studio (free, reliable)
- **Audio:** Use close mic, reduce background noise
- **Camera:** Optional webcam in corner (adds personality)

### During Recording
- **Speak to camera**, not screen
- **Use laser pointer/cursor** when referencing diagrams
- **Pause 2-3 seconds** between slide transitions
- **Vary your pitch** to avoid monotone
- **Smile** at key achievements

### Post-Production
- **Trim silence** at start/end
- **Check audio levels** (normalize if needed)
- **Add title card** with slide number (optional but professional)
- **Upload as Unlisted** to YouTube
- **Test link** in incognito mode before submitting

---

## Customization Needed

Before recording, replace these placeholders:

1. **Slide 1:**
   - `[Your Name]` → Your actual name
   - `[Your UoW ID]` → Your University of Westminster ID
   - `[Your IIT ID]` → Your IIT Student ID
   - `[Supervisor Name]` → Your supervisor's full name

2. **Speech Script:**
   - Same placeholders in opening (0:00-0:40 section)

3. **Gantt Chart (Slide 11):**
   - If your actual timeline differs, update dates
   - Adjust variance explanations to match reality

4. **Progress Since PPRS (Slide 12):**
   - Verify what was actually in your PPRS submission
   - Adjust "completed" claims if needed
